*scrilla* is a financial analysis application written in Python. It started as a command line utility for retrieving financial data and optimizing portfolio allocations over historical samples, but has since expanded to cover a wide range of analytical tools. I have developed a GUI wrapper around its main functions for easier user access. Give it a go! See the documentation for more information on installation.
