*scrilla* is a financial analysis application written in Python. It started as a command line utility for retrieving financial data and optimizing portfolio allocations over historical samples, but has since expanded to cover a wide range of analytical tools. I have developed a GUI wrapper around its main functions for easier user access. Give it a go! See the documentation for more information on installation.

### Ontology

*ontology* is a 2D game engine that implements [Liberated Pixel Cup](https://lpc.opengameart.org/) specification. It is written to ingest configuration YAML markup and generate worlds based solely on the parsed values. 

I started this back in 2012-ish, right after the Liberated Pixel Cup actually occurred. Initially it was just a fun way to learn to programming and engineering paradigms, but it has since evolved into a way for me to experiment with various ideas. I go back to this project every few years and try to improve it. I have a vision of what it is supposed to be, but there are lots of things to do before I can call it complete.

I would like to design a dynamic game engine without any determinate scripting. I want this to be a way of creating a virtual world through some basic configuration and then allowing it to evolve according to its own logic. I have been trying to craft an NPC reaction system that affects in-game events, but the logic is becoming very complicated. Next time I return to this project, I will probably try to revamp the NPC logic a bit.

### Bishop Walsh Math

I taught AP Statistics at Bishop Walsh High School during the 2023 - 2024 school year (I also subbed for the AP Calculus course while the regular teacher was out on leave). In doing so, I cobbled together a website using Python and Sphinx for the students to use. You can find my efforts at [bw-math](https://bishopwalshmath.org). You may freely use anything you find on the website. It's got a ton of great resources for learning probability and statistics!
