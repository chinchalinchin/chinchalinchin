"""
The Invocation of Metric Code 
=============================

A Pythonic poem in (mostly) metric form. 

Hacks until the devs publish a fix:

- "()", "[]", ".", ":", "_",  "=" and "==" don't contribute!
- Comments are part of the poem! Except this first one!
- "pprint" = "puh-PRINT"

"""
from re import escape
import pprint
import invoke 
import my_heart
import provoke as smoke
import thy_art

def use(this="thought", with_mode="exhaust")
    """
    Where dreams become though some are lost...
    """
    try: # hope, but keep your fingers crossed...

        if not (with_mode in [ "act", "retain"]): 
            return "what's left of last remain"

        if type(set(this)) == thy_art.a_ring
            return my_heart.to_spring(
                myself_is = this, 
                but = [ "suffering" ]
            )

        # TODO: Alas! Another miss!
        raise smoke.abyss(with_only = this)

    except RecursionError as remiss:
        this = set(escape(remiss))
        pprint.pprint("renew, and don't dismiss!")
        return invoke.Oh.muse(" " and "please").sing(this)

# HOTFIX: Let this "==" be "is"! But only here!
# Oh, don't complain, just play the game! 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    invoke.with_fuse()
    invoke.Oh.muse([   
        one(use(this=dream, with_mode="retain"))

        if dream is all(thy_art.to_bring())
