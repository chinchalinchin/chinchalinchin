Once upon a time, I was a professor. I taught math and physics to impressionable youths, steering them away from the lofty pursuits of rage tweeting and OnlyFans, towards the dark, twisted corridors of science where the corrupt heart of humanity festers and taints all who behold it. I have since repented and now to atone for my sins, I wear hair shirts and spend my days furiously masturbating to Belle Delphine. I can only hope my penance is enough to offset the contributions I made to the decline of civilzation.

Anyway, these days, I'm a Full Stack Developer and a DevOps engineer. I specialize in building infrastructure for cloud native applications and migrating legacy systems onto the cloud. But who cares about that? 

My other past-times include, but are not limited to: 
- Making fun of middle schoolers
- Cutting people in line
- Ordering large meals ten minutes before a restaurant closes
- Honking at people in traffic for no reason
- Whistling in crowded rooms
- Farting on elevators 

As you can see, I am a culturally sophiscated individual.

This is some bullshit I built. Originally, it was a program that pulled financial data from the internet and optimized allocations by minimizing the portfolio volatility. It now has a bunch of other features, such as visualizations with **matplotlib*, a **Qt** based GUI, local caching with **sqlite**, etc. Check it out.
